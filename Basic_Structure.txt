Basics of SoarPilot

soaring.c - Main Routines

static int StartApplication(void)
- Launches SoarPilot, initialises the databases, and sets default values etc
- Then hands over to the start up form (moving map / final glide / set QNH)

Boolean ApplicationHandleEvent(EventPtr event)
- This is the main event handler.
The case frmLoadEvent: statement loads the events that will be repeated based on the particular form being viewed.
- The case menuEvent: statement handles any interaction with the drop down menus
- The case nilEvent: handles the tasks that SoarPilot needs to run continuously in the background. ie: the calculations for arrival altitudes, entering sectors, wind etc etc

Boolean PreprocessEvent(EventPtr event)
- This handles interaction with the hardware and silk screen buttons

soarForm.c
- This routines are the event handlers for the main forms within SoarPilot
- These are called by frmLoadEvent: event in the ApplicationHandleEvent routine.
- The headers for these routine are in the soaring.h file

soarForm.h / soaring.rcp
- These defines are all the elements on all the forms that are defined in the soaring.rcp file
